# Linux CAN

Dart implementation of SocketCAN.

Big shout out to [@ardera](https://github.com/ardera) who helped me a lot developing this package.

## Using the package

There are no system dependenices needed, except the `libc.so.6` which probably should be installed on your device.

### Setup

At first create a `CanDevice`. You can set a custom bitrate, default is 500 000. Afterwards call `setup()`. A `SocketException` will be thrown if something goes wrong.

```dart
final canDevice = CanDevice(bitrate: 250000);
await canDevice.setup();
```

### Communication

To receive data use `read()`, which returns a `CanFrame`. It contains the id and data of the frame.

```dart
final frame = canDevice.read();
print("Frame id: ${frame.id}");
print("Frame data: ${frame.data}");
```

To close the socket use `close()`.

## Limitations

- Because I have no hardware which allows writing CAN data, only reading is supported at the moment.
- For now only `can0` is supported as an interface.
- You can not change the bitrate once it is set. To change the bitrate a reboot of your device is currently needed.
